# MyReads Project

This MyReads app represents too many hours to accurately report, and relies on too many collaborators to adequately cover. However I want to acknowledge the invaluable help from Project Coaches Doug Brown and Jason Michael White. I also want to thank my study buddy Susan Pommer who has been a constant source of support and good cheer.

MyReads started with starter code provided by Udacity

The project dependencies were installed with `npm install` and a Python server initiates with `npm start` at http://localhost:3000/.

## Objective of MyReads App

This App is designed to search an API provided by Udacity and be able to shift the books found there between different shelves: "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", and "Read".


## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
